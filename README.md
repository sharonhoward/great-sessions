## Denbighshire Gaol Files 1660-1730 - a finding aid

**denbighshire_gaol_files_1660-1730_v1-0.tsv**

* This data is based on working lists I made for my research as a PhD student and may contain errors.
* The FamilySearch website doesn't facilitate linking to sessions, unfortunately: [browse the gaol files from here](https://familysearch.org/search/image/index?owc=9SBR-BZ9%3A383499601%3Fcc%3D2040546). 
* Some file references in FamilySearch differ from those listed in Glyn Parry's *Guide to the Great Sessions*. Where this is the case I give both references.
* Document numbers refer to the archivists' numbering of the original documents, **NOT** the FamilySearch image numbers. But they should nonetheless aid location of documents within the files.
* Between 1702 and 1730, the documents are not numbered, but they are listed in the order in which they were filed when I consulted them. It is *possible* (though I would hope unlikely) that the ordering could have been altered when the files were unbound for digitisation.
